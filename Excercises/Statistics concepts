Mean
• AKA Average
• Sum / number of samples
Median
• If you have an even number of samples,take the average of the two in the middle.
• Median is less susceptible to outliers than the mean

Mode
• The most common value in a data set
▫ Not relevant to continuous numerical data

Variance measures how “spread-out” the data is.
• Variance (σ 2 ) is simply the average of the squared differences from the mean

Moments
• Quantitative measures of the shape of a probability density function
• Mathematically they are a bit hard to wrap your head around:
▫ μ n =
∞
−∞
x − c n f x dx (for moment n around value c)
• But intuitively, it’s a lot simpler in statistics.
The first moment is the mean.
The second moment is the variance.
--> third moment is “skew” (γ)
• How “lopsided” is the distribution?
• A distribution with a longer tail on the left will be skewed left, and havea negative skew.
-->The fourth moment is “kurtosis”
• How thick is the tail, and how sharp is the peak, compared to a normal
distribution?
• Example: higher peaks have higher kurtosis
