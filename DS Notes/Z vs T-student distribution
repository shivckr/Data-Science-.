when to use Z distribution
 1. population SD is knwon(sigma)
 2. sample size is >30
 
 z = x – μ / σ, 
 T-distribution
  z = x – μ / s, 
 except that x̄ (the sample mean) is used instead of μ (the population mean) and
 s (the sample standard deviation) is used instead of σ (the population standard deviation).
