DT:
---------------------
when Input  variable not linarly impacting output variable thats when we go for  DT generally.
most commonly used in classification problem, but it works for both continues & catogorical datsets

DT Idea is to divide the data in homogenious class, then it is easy to classify.
Lower the value of GINI index higher is the homogenity


IG measures the disorganization in the system known as entropy.


Steps to calculate entropy:
 ----------------------------
  1: calculate the entropy of parent node
  2: calculate the entropy of each individual node of split & calculate the weighted avg of all sub node available in split.

Entropy is more fair as compaired to gini index, since it uses logrithm and normalize the the value.
Gini index has mas value 0.5 in Binary classification. 

Questions in DT:
--------------------
1..why scaling is not required in DT & RF?
2..what to do if features have high correlation in DT
3.. why do we go for RF? 
    overfit problem, when data works for only for training model.


EDA in DT:
-----------------------
>>For Numerical features:
use lmplot, Boxplot

>>for Catogorical Features:
  use countplot, factorplot, 

>> to find out correaltion among features:
     use heatmap
      sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
     
>>  find out out which features have correlations using above plots

Feature Engineering:
-------------------------
>> check if data is imbalance 
>> dummification of catogorical values 
      pd.get_dummies(dataframe, drop_first=True)
>> Merging dummified and categorical columns.
      pd.concat([num_df,cat_cols], axis=1 )

Methods used:
----------------------------------
dataframe.head()
dataframe.tail()
telco_df.isna().sum()
telco_df.info()
telco_df.describe()
corr = telco_df.corr()----------used in EDA
