Mean
 AKA Average
 Sum / number of samples
 Example:
▫ Number of children in each house on my street:
0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0
The MEAN is (0+2+3+2+1+0+0+2+0) / 9 = 1.11

Median
• Sort the values, and take the value at the midpoint.
• Example:
0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0
Sort it:
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3

Median
• If you have an even number of samples,
take the average of the two in the middle.
• Median is less susceptible to outliers than
the mean
▫ Example: mean household income in the US
is $72,641, but the median is only $51,939 –
because the mean is skewed by a handful of
billionaires.
▫ Median better represents the “typical”
American in this example

Mode
• The most common value in a data set
▫ Not relevant to continuous numerical data
• Back to our number of kids in each house example:
0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0
How many of each value are there?
0: 4, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1
The MODE is 0

Variance measures how “spread-out” the data is.

• Variance (σ 2 ) is simply the average of the squared differences from the
mean
• Example: What is the variance of the data set (1, 4, 5, 4, 8)?

First find the mean: (1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 4.4
Now find the differences from the mean: (-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)
Find the squared differences: (11.56, 0.16, 0.36, 0.16, 12.96)
Find the average of the squared differences:
σ 2 = (11.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 12.96) / 5 = 5.04


Standard Deviation σ is just the square root of the
variance.
2.5
σ 2 = 5.04
2
1.5
σ = 5.04 = 2.24
So the standard deviation of
(1, 4, 5, 4, 8) is 2.24.

This is usually used as a way to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than
one standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual.
we can think,  how extreme a data point is by talking about “how many
sigmas” away from the mean it is.
